# Vietnam Workshop Feb 2024

This repository includes six core RMDs spanning the following topics:

1. RStudio and Basic Programming
2. Tidyverse and Data Cleaning
3. Basic Review and Creating Tables
4. Continuous Tests (T-test, ANOVA)
5. Categorical Tests (Chi-Square, Predictive Measures)
6. Introduction to Regression

These RMDs are designed to be opened in RStudio so students can explore and edit code as they follow lectures (the RMDs, knit to HTMLs). An additional RMD, originally meant to be the third lecture, covers visualization using ggplot2 in addition to tables.

7. Exploratory Data Analysis (ggplot2) and Tables
